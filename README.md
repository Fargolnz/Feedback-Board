# 💬 Feedback Board

A simple feedback management system built with FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows users to submit feedback and enables administrators to review and update the status of submitted feedback through a dashboard.

The application was developed as a small end-to-end product, focusing on simplicity, maintainability, and rapid delivery.

## ✨ Features

### 👤 User Side

* Submit feedback
* Provide a title and message
* Automatic feedback status assignment

### 🛡️ Admin Dashboard

* Secure Authentication for dashboard access
* View all submitted feedback
* Track feedback status
* Update feedback status

### 📬 Supported Statuses

* **Registered** (default status when feedback is created)
* **Under Review**
* **Resolved**

---

## 🔐 Authentication
To enhance security and prevent unauthorized status changes, a simple authentication system has been implemented:

* **Admin Login:** Users must enter a username and password to access the admin dashboard

* **Route Protection:** Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page when attempting to access the dashboard

* **Session Management:** Upon successful login, user information is stored in the session; clicking the logout button clears the session

* **Simple Validation:** Currently uses hardcoded credentials, with the flexibility to extend to a database-based authentication system in the future

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

### 🌐 Backend

* **FastAPI** - Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs
* **SQLAlchemy** - Powerful ORM for database interaction
* **SQLite** - Lightweight, zero-configuration database

### 🎨 Frontend

* **Jinja2 Templates** - Server-side template rendering engine
* **Bootstrap 5** - Responsive CSS framework for clean UI design

### 🐳 Containerization
* **Docker** - Containerization for consistent development and deployment
* **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration for easy management

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### 1️⃣ Why FastAPI?

FastAPI provides a lightweight and modern framework that allows rapid backend development while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

### 2️⃣ Why SQLite?

SQLite is sufficient for the scope of this project and requires zero external configuration, making the setup process simple.

### 3️⃣ Why Server-Side Rendering?

Since the project requirements are relatively small, Jinja2 templates provide a simpler solution than introducing a separate frontend framework.

### 4️⃣ Why Session-Based Authentication?

Using sessions for authentication management is a simple and effective approach for small projects that don't require JWT or OAuth implementation. It integrates seamlessly with Jinja2 templates and provides a straightforward user experience.

### 5️⃣ Why Docker?

Docker ensures the application runs consistently across any system, eliminates complex manual setup, and isolates the app from your host environment—allowing you to run the project with just a few simple commands.
